                <span style="font-size: 175%">A</span>s the world becomes more digital, the need for technical knowledge to achieve mainstream appeal increases. However, technical detail isn't always the most entertaining subject to study, and it's typically overlooked by the mainstream because of just that. In a perfect world, problem solving would be considered a primary source of entertainment, children would spend their most impressionable years learning automation designs, and most of all technology would connect us more so than it disconnects us. To achieve a world in which most people are technologically educated, we'll need to make that education accessible and enjoyable to most people. We'll need to make it more and more mainstream. And in order for it to be mainstream, not only must it be of high quality, but it must also be attractive in some way, flashy, or family friendly.

            <p>
                 In order to achieve these goals, technological knowledge must achieve mainstream appeal. In many American public schools, the children don't value academic learning. They don't value it because it is boring and under-stimulating. The value of academic learning has been taken for granted, and so little to no effort has been put into making it irresistable, addicting, and easy to consume.

                If you're interested in teaching the greatest number of people, then whatever teaching method you employ should be of high quality, and of great mainstream appeal. It should be flashy, or sweet, or whatever is necessary to connect with your learners. In this Docker Hearts experiment, we will explore the concept of seducing the mainstream into a high-learning scenario, through flashy, cute video-gaming appeal.
