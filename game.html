                Some things are easier for the browser to animate than others. Changing an element's position, size, and opacity are cheap and easy, whereas completely redrawing elements becomes taxing on system resources. The characters in this game are moving images and gifs, rather than redrawn frames on a canvas, to ensure all devices continue to run smoothly even while the game is active.

                The fundamental concept, is that a player can drop bash scripts on the ground, and then some other player can come by and collect the scripts in real time to get points. The catch is that whenever a script is collected, it is then executed within the container of the player who collected it. If a special file called the <span style="color: darkred">heart</span> file is missing from the container after execution, the player loses one heart. When you run out of hearts, you die.

                Each bash script has the potential to cause catastrophic side-effects to a container, especially with commands like "alias", "apt-get", "echo", "rm", and so on. At the inn, players can trade in their points to buy protective items, for example the test tube item, to test the effect of cryptic codes before collecting them.
