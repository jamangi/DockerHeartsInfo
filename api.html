            <h1>The Nest</h1>
            <p>
                Every user in the game is tied to one docker container at a time, and the code they collect gets executed within their container. All of the containers in the game reside within a python application known as the <span style="color: darkred"> Nest</span>. The Nest allows us to manipulate containers at the application level, so we can create, destroy, and test within containers in response to the actions of our users. The Nest also has the ability to push containers to DockerHub whenever a user logs out, and also load containers from DockerHub whenever a user logs in. Docker Hearts is built upon the Nest.

              <p>update - execute bash code within a container</p>
              <p>destroy - shutdown and remove a container</p>

            <h1>Multiplayer Broadcasting Unit (MBU)</h1>
            <p>
                The <span style="color: darkred">MBU</span> is what allows players to interact in real time. Whenever a player sends a message to the MBU (move, talk, collect/drop script, buy, sell, etc), the message is broadcasted to the other connected clients. This relies on websockets, and differs from AJAX in that clients need not disconnect and reconnect in order to recieve the continuous updates.

              <p>create_character - adds a new character to the world and broadcasts the change</p>

              <p>update_character - change location of a character and broadcasts the change</p>
              <p>delete_character - removes a character from the world and broadcasts the change</p>

            <h1>Database</h1>
            <p>
                The <span style="color: darkred">Database</span> contains all of the users and scripts that exist within the world of Docker Hearts. It differs from the Nest in that it specializes and is optimized for storing data, whereas the Nest is better used for testing scripts.

            <h1>User Interface</h1>
            <p>
                The <span style="color: darkred">User Interface</span> is how a user interacts with the application. It transmits the user's actions to the MBU, which broadcasts them to other user interfaces connected on the network. It displays the events incoming from the MBU for the users, and defines their experience of the game.

              <summary>User Interface</summary>
              <br>
              <p>move - each click emits a message to the MBU for broadcasting the character's intent to move</p>
              <p>talk - entering a message in the chat emits the text to the MBU for broadcasting to those nearby</p>
              <p>make_script - designing a script emits a message to the MBU, which forwards the message to the Database for storage</p>
              <p>drop_script - dropping a script emits a message to the MBU to apply that script to the map so that others may then collect it</p>
              <p>collect_script - collecting a script emits a message resulting in the script being executed within the player's container, and then removed from the map and database</p>
              <p>loot - when a player dies, their sac of scripts can be looted by others, which differs from collecting scripts in that looted scripts are not executed and can be used by the looter</p>
              <p>buy - an AJAX request to buy a particular item, which will then be added to the user's inventory in the Database</p>
